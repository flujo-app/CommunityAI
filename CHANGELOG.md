# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to CommunityAI are documented here. Detailed engineering
and qualification evidence remains in `docs/REVIVAL_TEST_RESULTS.md`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Persistent multi-model local node with authenticated OpenAI-compatible inference and a
  separately authorized control API.
- PySide desktop foundation with native credential ownership, model and route status,
  client-key management, worker controls, single-instance ownership, and login startup.
- Authenticated desktop contribution status and whole-policy editing for model admission,
  schedule suspension, storage, VRAM, bandwidth, power, measured telemetry, pause timing,
  and unavailable-provider reasons.
- Exact content-addressed model manifests, verified artifacts, signed worker identities,
  encrypted manifested transport, bounded failure recovery, and signed catalog/bootstrap
  formats.
- Qwen3.5 2B and Gemma 4 E2B first-rung candidate manifests with Windows CPU parity and
  local selected-worker recovery evidence.
- Authoritative opt-in contribution policies for model admission, storage, scheduling,
  VRAM, bandwidth, power, and bounded pause behavior.
- Provider-neutral separate-machine qualification controller and a Fly Machines adapter
  with selected-worker hard kill and fail-closed resource cleanup.
- A fail-closed combined GCP/Fly qualification cost guard with a conservative USD 69
  four-host GCP plan and exact isolated create, cleanup, and cleanup-verification targets.
- Exact-snapshot qualification image preparation with commit-derived tracked-only source
  contexts, exact candidate-manifest binding, digest-pinned base images, bounded
  source-bound tags, credential-free offline runtime inputs, provenance/SBOM push plans,
  and in-image source, Dockerfile, manifest, byte-inventory, and artifact re-verification
  for Qwen3.5 2B and Gemma 4 E2B.
- Fail-closed qualification-image publication evidence that binds Buildx metadata to an
  immutable GHCR index, exact Linux runtime, SLSA provenance, SPDX SBOM, contract labels,
  every compressed layer, measured uncompressed size, and a bounded Fly rootfs plan.
- A public-alpha operations runbook with privacy-safe aggregate health reconstruction,
  finite admission defaults, rollout stop conditions, and reversible disable/rollback
  steps.

### Changed

- Defined the first release as a Windows/Linux public inference alpha. macOS and all
  credit/payment features are explicitly deferred and will not be advertised as available.
- Model qualification now treats exact Windows/Linux CPU/CUDA coverage as the strict
  public-alpha matrix; macOS CPU/MPS evidence is collected as a separate deferred gate.
- Fly qualification now reuses the existing native `flyctl` login by default instead of
  requiring a manually supplied token environment variable.
- Fly Machine provisioning now derives its immutable runtime manifest and measured rootfs
  size from exact Gate 4 publication evidence and rejects altered manifests, references,
  layers, or ceilings before provider authentication or resource creation.
- Model qualification dispatch no longer requires a persistent GitHub runner-inventory
  administration token.
- Production desktop CI now packages the public alpha on Windows and Linux only; macOS
  packaging remains explicitly deferred.
- Windows desktop activation uses a bounded event-driven local-instance probe, avoiding
  a named-pipe deadlock during startup and CI validation.
- Root product messaging now describes public inference and optional compute sharing
  without claiming that credits, earnings, or spending already exist.
- The desktop sharing page now reflects node-authoritative worker intent and enforced
  limits. Its former local-only VRAM preference is replaced by a complete node-backed
  editor; blocked workers cannot look startable, and workers must be paused before an
  atomic policy replacement while pause itself remains available.

### Security

- Public model loading fails closed on manifest, artifact, execution-profile, signed
  announcement, PeerID, transport, revocation, expiry, and rollback mismatches.
- Desktop control credentials remain separate from inference keys and live in native OS
  credential storage when the desktop owns the node.
- Contribution status is bounded and fail-closed, excludes worker PIDs, logs, and raw
  failure details, and rejects malformed, inconsistent, non-finite, or unbounded telemetry.
- Contribution-policy writes require the privileged control credential, a current
  whole-config revision, strict complete-policy validation, paused workers, a shared
  cross-process writer lock, and an atomic Windows/Linux exchange that detects and restores
  commit-boundary conflicts without weakening the active supervisor.
- Temporary provider qualification resources are bound to exact run metadata and cannot
  produce a passing report unless complete cleanup is proven.
- Manifested public workers now take inference leases before reading a stream, enforce
  shared global/per-PeerID active and rate limits, bound hashed identity/session state
  and aggregate activation pushes, reject stale route generations, fail closed on
  admission-manager faults, and disable training RPCs unless explicitly enabled.
- Routine manifested-worker stream rejections retain their explicit client RPC errors
  while traceback logs are coalesced into bounded, identifier-free aggregate warnings;
  unavailable admission state and unexpected faults retain complete diagnostic tracebacks.

### Not included in the first public alpha

- Credits, receipts, balances, payments, earnings, payouts, or a compute marketplace.
- macOS support.
- Stable-service or production-SLO claims.
